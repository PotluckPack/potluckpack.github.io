  <h1> Welcome to the Potluck Modpack </h1>
  I know this site sucks. But it fucking works. It's made with
  Github Pages and self-loathing.

  <br /><br />


  <h2> Modlist </h2>
  To check the modlist out, <a href="/modlist.html">click here</a>.

  <br />

  Suggestions for mods are closed right now.


  <h2> Download </h2>
  Calm down, I've still to complete the modpack. Here's is a rough roadmap:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make the autists at /mcg/ throw mods in the potluck
    </li>
    <li>
      Finalize the modlist to something that actually runs &larr; WE ARE HERE
    </li>
    <li>
      Publish the modlist and open a suggestion box, to actually get an idea of
      what the fuck /mcg/ wants.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make tweaks and modify stuff based on the suggestion box, maybe making
      some mods too
    </li>
    <li>
      Close the suggestion box to avoid a constant influx of autistic suggestions
      during the fixing stuff phases, and fix stuff.
    </li>
    <li>
      Publish a first version of the pack and reopen the suggestion box, stopping
      development for a short while to see how the situation evolves.
    </li>
    <li>
      Update the pack until it can be considered completed
    </li>
    <li>
      Finish development
    </li>
  </ol>


  <h2> What should the pack be? </h2>
  This one isn't up for suggestions. The Potluck Pack is not a progression pack,
  nor a plot one. Minecraft is a sandbox, and the creation of the modpack itself
  followed a very sandbox philosophy. As such, even though an actual rough
  progression should be delineated for the sake of having the various options
  be balanced with each other, don't expect this to be anything more than
  a loop of building stuff with other stuff with no clear goal aside
  from enjoying the autism.

  <br>

  Another page will be setup when the modlist is complete to explain the actual
  design of the pack, but basically, think of it being like the good old times
  when you actually had a choice in what mod to use for a certain task and there
  were multiple solutions to the same problem, instead of one efficient solution
  based on the "age" you're in. Some solutions may lose in efficiency, but no
  problem should ever have a single way to solve it.

  <br>

  There is also an incredibly high amount of difficulty and exploration mods,
  which makes for breaks from autistic factory making and for actual reasons to
  make defense systems, weapons, and armor.

  <br>

  Last but not least, expect a lot of tweaks, and some mods to be quite different,
  with edits done by means of making an actual mod.
  The pack, for instance, contains multiple iterations of Gregtech, but it won't
  be the main mod and heavy modifications will be done to ensure that.


  <h2> Contact me </h2>
  If you need to contact me, just write on /mcg/. I'll make sure to answer.

  <h2> Suggestion Box </h2>
  Here, I'll house a suggestion box as soon as I've completed the modlist. It'll
  probably require you to enable Javascript.
